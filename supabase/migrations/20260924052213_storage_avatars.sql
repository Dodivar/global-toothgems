-- =============================================================================
-- Migration 011 — Storage: private avatars bucket (iteration 2)
-- =============================================================================
-- Profile pictures are personal data: PRIVATE bucket, served through signed
-- URLs. Each user owns the folder named after their user id:
--   avatars/<auth.uid()>/<file>
-- profiles.avatar_path stores that object path.
-- Admins can read avatars (support / moderation) and delete them (moderation).
-- =============================================================================
